# Crafty Carts (REMAKE!)
Crafting stations on wheels! Comes with built in storage and lights

`Install on the server if you wish to enforce the configurations for the recipes.`

```
If the mod is installed on the server, the client must have the mod, or they will be kicked for a version mismatch.

NOTE: This mod uses ServerSync and a File watcher. Changes to the server config file will sync to clients, no server reboot needed.
      Changes via the BepInEx Configuration Manager by an admin will change the server config and sync to all clients. (Admin must be in game)
```

This is a remake of the original mod by RoloPogo (all credit for the assets goes to them!).
