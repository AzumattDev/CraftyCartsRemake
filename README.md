Adds a katana to the game. Nothing more. Fully configurable. Zappelfab request in OdinPlus discord.


```
If the mod is installed on the server, the client must have the mod, or they will be kicked for a version mismatch.

NOTE: This mod uses ServerSync and a File watcher. Changes to the server config file will sync to clients, no server reboot needed.
      Changes via the BepInEx Configuration Manager by an admin will change the server config and sync to all clients. (Admin must be in game)
```
