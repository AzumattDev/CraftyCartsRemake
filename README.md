- Update all the code to now be completely different from the original. (Code can be found here [CraftyCartsRemake Github](https://github.com/AzumattDev/CraftyCartsRemake))
- Fixed issue with flicker of the cart's material by rebuilding the carts in Unity, not code.
- Logout and back in issue resolved by using my PieceManager's code.
- Made the carts harder to tip over. (Please note: By default, the heaver the cart gets...the harder it is to pull.)
